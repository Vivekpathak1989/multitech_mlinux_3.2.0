It is your responsibility to review each license of the contained products 
to understand what is, and what is not, allowed by each such license.

The OpenEmbedded-Core common-licenses directory 'layers/openembedded-core/meta/files/common-licenses/' 
contains licenses represented within this distribution. To the extent a license 
is not contained in the 'common-licenses' directory, it is referenced in the

Different components of OpenEmbedded-Core are under different licenses (a mix
of MIT and GPLv2). Please see:

For licensing information for other layers, see the files included with 
that particular layer in the layers subdirectory.
