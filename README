============================================================

What is it?
-----------

mLinux is a distribution provided by MultiTech tailored for the 
MultiConnect Conduit products (MTCDT models).

mLinux utilizes OpenEmbedded-Core, Bitbake, which are part of the Yocto Project.

How to get started?
-------------------

1. Build from tarball

    Download the file 'mLinux-x.tar.gz' (where 'x' is the version) from 
    http://www.multitech.net or copy it from the storage medium bundled with
    your developer kit.  This file provides the mLinux build system and a set 
    of sources sufficient for building the sample images provided by mLinux.

    Untar the contents to a folder of your choice, and install prerequisite packages. 
    Then, configure the environment variables and you are good to go.  
    
    Note that mLinux should *not* be built as root and you will need full write 
    permissions to the build directory structure.  It is recommended to extract and
    build the software inside your $HOME dir as a normal user.

    tar xzf mLinux-3.0.0.tar.gz
    cd mlinux-3.0.0
    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh
    source env-oe.sh

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    bitbake mlinux-base-image

2. Build from git repository

    # clone repo to a dir name of your choice
    git clone git://git.multitech.net/mlinux.git mlinux-3.0.0
    cd mlinux-3.0.0

    # checkout desired branch or tag
    git checkout 3.0.0

    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh

    # initialize git submodules and setup dir structure
    ./setup.sh

    # setup environment
    source env-oe.sh

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    # build!
    bitbake mlinux-base-image
